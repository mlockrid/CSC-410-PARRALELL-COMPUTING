matrix multiplication:
To compile:
- gcc mainM.c 

This program takes two matrixes of equal size, multiplies the integers in the same positions and puts them in a third matrix. It is using nested for loops

nQueens:
To compile
- gcc mainQ.c 

This program checks if all the positions in a row are safe to place a queen, if a safe row is found, then the function is called again, with the row incremented 
by one. Once all rows on the board are filled, that solution is printed by the printBoar function which is just two nested for loops that check for a queen and prints
either a . or a Q.

arraySum:
To compile gcc arraysum.c 

This program takes an array and adds the elements together using a for loop and a running sum total.
